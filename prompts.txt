"I am a Data Engineering student and a Veterinary Clinic owner working on a project called 'Vet-Analytics'.

My Goal: Build a data pipeline to analyze my clinic's operational and financial efficiency.

Current Context: I am building the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) prototype using Python and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook environment. I am simulating an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflow.

Key Technical Constraints:

Reproducibility: I must never manually edit the raw data source (Excel/CSV); all cleaning must happen in Python code.

Business Logic: still working on it 

Future Stack: Eventually, this will move to BigQuery and dbt, but right now I am focusing on Python logic.

Please act as my Senior Data Engineer pair-programmer. help me write clean, commented, and efficient Pandas code to ingest, clean, and visualize my clinic data."
